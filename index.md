Daily handoffs are an integral part of [Follow-the-sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follow-the-sun) development. In order to efficiently start performing your daily handoffs, we have outlined a number of key guidelines you should take into account. These guidelines aim to ease your way into successfully performing Follow-the-sun development.

## 1. Be concise
The overlap in time you and your peers have might be limited. In order to use this time effectively, make sure to stay concise during your handoff. Taking a lot of time discussing minute details wastes the limited amount of communication time you have with your peers, which may result in important details being overlooked!

## 2. Be precise
Transferring your knowledge is difficult, but is the cornerstone of the daily handoff. Miscommunications are difficult to be resolved as you are no longer working even though your peers across the globe are. To make sure your peers can work productively it is important to be precise in the information you share, and making sure they understand the tasks at hand.

## 3. Be prepared
This might seem like stating the obvious, but you should be prepared for your daily handoff before you start the meeting. Spending time deciding on what information you need to transfer to your peers wastes precious time which could be used to ensure everyone is up to speed on the development!

## 4. Test your communication
This follows nicely from being prepared. Be sure the methods you are using to communicate with your peers work correctly! Spending time troubleshooting during your daily handoff wastes time, and should obviously be avoided!

## 5. Use a fixed structure
Use a structured way of transferring your knowledge to your peers. Having every handoff be in the same format allows you to not waste time determining what to discuss next, as all meetings will follow the same workflow.

## 6. Allow written handoffs
At times it might be impossible to perform your daily handoff with a video conference. This might be the case because the next team has a national day off, or are simply on vacation. Even though it is less than ideal to write everything down, make sure you and your peers use a structure of communicating where this is possible as it will inevitably happen.

## 7. Work test driven
This is great advice for Follow-the-sun development in general, but is especially important for the daily handoff! Having your requirements defined as tests means there is an unambiguous language you can use when communicating with your peers. This means less time needs to be spent on discussing the details of every task, and more time can be spent expanding the general knowledge of the project. This also has the benefit of easily seeing which tasks have been finished and which are still open by looking at the delivered test results during the handoff.

## 8. Experiment
Experiment with the guidelines provided. If you and your peers can work more effectively by ignoring one or more of the methods described, please do so! The goal of the daily handoff is the fast and effective sharing of knowledge between you and your peers all over the globe. If you find ways which work better for you and your team, adopt them and evolve them!
